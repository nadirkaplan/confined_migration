The provided codes simulate cell migration in curved and confined channels on viscoelastic substrates. The following key parameters in the "RacRho_reinforced#.py" files can be adjusted to conduct parametric studies on curvature, confinement, and viscoelastic properties:

    Curvature: Modify 'conf_R = 200.0' in "RacRho_reinforced1.py" to simulate curved channels with different radii (curvatures).

    Channel Width: Modify 'conf_width = 8.0' in "RacRho_reinforced1.py" to investigate migration in channels of varying widths.

    Viscoelastic Properties: Adjust 'K_a = 3.0' and 'gamma_sub = 0.10' in "RacRho_reinforced2.py" to explore viscoelastic effects.

    Substrate Stiffness & Confinement: Modify 'K_l = 0.10' in "RacRho_reinforced3.py" to study the impact of substrate stiffness. Additionally, change 'conf_width = 10.0' to examine different confinement conditions.
